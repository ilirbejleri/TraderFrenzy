Trader Frenzy lets you feel like a top preforming trader by walking around a room of 
"pits" and being offered contracts that may or may not return a proft.

You enter the trading floor and can move around with the arrow keys. There are 6 pits. 
When a pit is green, then there is a contract for sale on it. When you go in it, you are
shown the details of the contract. The price is how much money it costs you, the percent
payout is the probability of recieving the payout, and the payout is the amount of 
money you get if the payout hits. Your total money score is on the bottom right, while 
the timer is on the left. You have 60 seocnds to make as much money as possible. On the
contract screen, you have the option to BUY or PASS. Click A to BUY, and B to PASS. When
you BUY it, you might get the payout, and your money balance will change by the Payout-price.
If it doesn't hit then your balance will change -= price. If you PASS, you go back to the
starting position and can continue trading. If a contract is not bought after 15 seconds,
a new one will appear after 5 more seconds. The same goes for when you buy one, a new one
will appear of 5 seconds. When time is up, you can see your score and press SELECT to play again. 
You can press SELECT at any time in the game to start over.
